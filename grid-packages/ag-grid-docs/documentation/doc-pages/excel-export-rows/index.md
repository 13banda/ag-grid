## Pinned Rows

If the pinned rows are not relevant to the data, they can be excluded from the export by using the `skipPinnedTop=true` and `skipPinnedBottom=true` params.

Note the following:

- By default, all pinned rows are exported.
- If `Skip Pinned Top Rows` is checked, the rows pinned at the top will be skipped.
- If `Skip Pinned Bottom Rows` is checked, the rows pinned at the bottom will be skipped.
