This section provides details on how to configure and customise filtering with Row Grouping.

## Group Column Filter

The Group Column Filter provides a simple way to configure filters on group columns. The filters defined on the columns in the grouping are used directly in the group columns, with the ability to switch between them.

See the [Group Column Filter](../grouping-column-filter/) section for more details.

## Custom Group Filtering

When more customisation is required for group filtering, Custom Group Filtering can be used. This allows different filters to be configured for the group columns than for the columns in the grouping.

See the [Custom Group Filtering](../grouping-custom-filtering/) section for more details.
