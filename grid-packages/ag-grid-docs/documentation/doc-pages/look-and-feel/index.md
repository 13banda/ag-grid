title: "Look & Feel"
---

Look & Feel refers to the overall design of the grid, which is controlled using CSS.

The grid Look & Feel is highly customisable:

- The first step is to select a [theme](/themes/) from one of our provided themes.

- Next you can [apply customisations](/look-and-feel-customisation/) to the theme using CSS variables and rules.

- Projects that are using Sass for their own styling needs should check out the [Sass API](look-and-feel-customisation-sass) which provides additional validation.

Alternatively if you want to change the appearance of individual columns, headers or cells then consider using [row styles](/row-styles/), [cell styles](/cell-styles/) or [custom renderers](/component-types/).
