This section covers the axis types supported by the sparklines

## Axis Types

The y values supplied in the sparkline data will always be plotted using the number axis on a continuous scale.

If x values are supplied in the data via the tuples or complex objects format, they are plotted using the category axis by default, which means the data points will be evenly spaced out along the width of the sparkline.

The type of x-axis used to plot the x values is configurable via the axis options to allow for meaningful presentation of the data pattern.

Deciding the x-axis type should be influenced by the nature of the data. X values can be of types `number`, `string`, `Date` or objects with a `toString` method, therefore,
different axis types may result in different visual displays of the data in the sparklines. This can be very useful when making comparisons and analysing relationships between variables.

Discrete x values such as `string` values or fixed numbers require a category axis whilst continuous values such as timestamps or numbers can be plotted on a number, time or category axis.

The supported axis types include:
- [Category](/sparklines-axis-types/#category-axis)
- [Number](/sparklines-axis-types/#number-axis)
- [Time](/sparklines-axis-types/#time-axis)

## Category Axis

The category axis is used as the x-axis by default. X values will be plotted on a band scale which means the data points will be evenly spaced out along the horizontal axis.

The category axis is ideal for small datasets with discrete values or categories.

To configure the axis type, simply add the `type` property to the axis options as shown below.

<snippet>
const gridOptions = {
    columnDefs: [
        {
            field: 'rateOfChange',
            cellRenderer: 'agSparklineCellRenderer',
            cellRendererParams: {
                sparklineOptions: {
                    axis: {
                        // this can be omitted as the x-axis type is 'category' by default
                        type: 'number'
                    }
                }
            },
        },
        // other column definitions ...
    ],
};
</snippet>

In the snippet above, the x-axis type is set to `category` but this is optional as the x-axis is `category` by default.

The following example demonstrates area sparklines rendered using a category axis.

- Note in the data.js file, the data for the `rateOfChange` field is of type `[string, number][]`, where x values are type `string`.
- String values are considered as categories as they are not quantitative and thus cannot take on all real values between two particular values.
- A category axis is also suitable for quantitative values which are discrete or fixed.

## Number Axis

The number axis is used as a value axis. When the number axis is used, the horizontal distance between the data points depends on the magnitude of the x values.

For the number axis type, the supplied x values must be `number` values as they will be plotted on a continuous scale with numeric intervals.

<snippet>
const gridOptions = {
    columnDefs: [
        {
            field: 'history',
            cellRenderer: 'agSparklineCellRenderer',
            cellRendererParams: {
                sparklineOptions: {
                    axis: {
                        // set x-axis type to 'number'
                        type: 'number'
                    }
                }
            },
        },
        // other column definitions ...
    ],
};
</snippet>

In the snippet above, the x-axis type is set to `number`. This is useful in the case where the magnitude of x values must be reflected in the sparkline through the horizontal distance between data points.

The example below shows the area sparklines rendered using a number axis.

- Note in the data.js file, the data for the `rateOfChange` field is of type `[number, number][]`, where x values are type `number`.

## Time Axis

The time axis is similar to the number axis in the sense that it is also used to plot continous values. It can be used for `number` values, which will be interpreted as timestamps derived from Unix time, or `Date` objects.

The following example demonstrates the time axis type.

- Note in the data.js file, the data for the `rateOfChange` field is of type `[Date, number][]`, where x values are `Date` objects.
- Though the default category axis would be valid, the x-axis has been configured to be of type `time` to depict a more meaningful data trend as the Ñ… values are `Date` objects.

<snippet>
const gridOptions = {
    columnDefs: [
        {
            field: 'rateOfChange',
            cellRenderer: 'agSparklineCellRenderer',
            cellRendererParams: {
                sparklineOptions: {
                    axis: {
                        // set x-axis type to 'time'
                        type: 'time'
                    }
                }
            },
        },
        // other column definitions ...
    ],
};
</snippet>
