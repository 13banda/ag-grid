This section compares the different ways row groups can be displayed in the grid.

## Single Column Tree 

Row groups are displayed under a single column tree.

As illustrated above, there is a single group column containing the `country` and `year` row groups in a single group hierarchy. 

See the [Single Column Tree](../grouping-single-column-tree/) section for more details.

## Multi-Column Tree
Separate group columns are used for each row group.

As illustrated above, the `country` and `year` row groups are displayed under separate group columns.

See the [Multi-Column Tree](../grouping-multi-column-tree/) section for more details.

## Row Tree

Row groups are displayed in a Row Tree.

<image-caption src="grouping-tree-display-types/resources/group-row-tree.png" alt="Row Tree" constrained="true" centered="true"></image-caption>

As illustrated above, the `country` and `year` row groups are displayed using group rows.

See the [Row Tree](../grouping-row-tree/) section for more details.

## Custom Tree

In some rare cases it may be desirable to supply your own custom groups rather than using the provided display types above. 

See the [Custom Tree](../grouping-custom-tree/) section for more details.
