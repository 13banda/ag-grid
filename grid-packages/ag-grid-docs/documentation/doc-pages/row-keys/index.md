title: "Row Keys"
---

Row Keys (or Row ID's) are provided by the application to the grid to enable the grid to identify rows. This in turn provides the following benefits:
1. Rows are not unnecessarily destroyed and recreated when a list of Row Data is refreshed.
1. Row selection is maintained when a list of Row Data is refreshed.
1. Rows are given an identifier which can be used by the application to identify and look up rows.

## Setting Row Keys

Setting Row Keys is done using the `getRowKey()` grid callback.

<snippet>
const gridOptions = {
    // assumes each data item provided by the application has the key stored in an attribute called id
    getRowKey: item => item.id
}
</snippet>

When providing Keys the following rules must be obeyed:

1. Keys must be unique
1. Keys must not change

[[note]]
|Note the word "Row Key" is often synonymous with "Row ID". It's common to refer to Row Keys as Row IDs. In the grid, the Key is stored on the Row Node in an attribute called `id`.

The example below has `getRowKey()` implemented to return `item.id`. When the grid is ready, the key `car-f` is used to look up a row from the grid's API and then select that Row.

See [Accessing Data](/accessing-data/) for more information on `getRowNode()` API.

## Grid Assigned Keys

If `getRowKey()` is not provided, Row Keys are generated by the grid when data is set into the grid. The grid uses a sequence starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 to assign row IDs, so if for example there are three rows they will have IDs of `0`, `1` and `2`. The Row Key does not change for a Row once it is set.

If the Row Data is updated to a new set, the grid will continue with it's sequence. For example if 10 rows are initially set, keys [0..9] are used. Then if the data is set again for another 10 rows, keys [10..19] are used. This is true even if the second set of rows are logically identical to the first set of rows (i.e. it's a refresh operation).

## Group Keys

When using [Row Grouping](/grouping/) the grid assigns keys to the row groups as the row groups are created. It uses 
another sequence again starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 and also prefixes the sequence number with `row-group-`. 
So if for example there are three groups they will have keys of `row-group-0`, `row-group-1` and `row-group-2`. If the 
groups are destroyed (eg the user removes the grouping) and recreated again (the user groups by a column) then new keys's 
will be created e.g. `row-group-3`, `row-group-4` and `row-group-5`. As with normal rows, the keys's for group rows do 
not change for as long as the row group exists, however removing and re-adding the grouping will result in new row 
group keys even if the row group represents the same group as before.

The grid will always assign keys for group levels. The callback `getRowKey()` is not used for groups.
