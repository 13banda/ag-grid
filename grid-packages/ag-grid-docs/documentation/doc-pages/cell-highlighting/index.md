title: "Cell Highlighting"
---

Cells can be highligted, flashed and animated based on their content and data changes.

- Set [Cell Styles](/cell-styles/) to apply CSS to cells, usually based on cell content.
- Cells can be [Flashed](/flashing-cells/) to bring the users attention to a particular cell.
- Changing data can use [Show Change Cell Components](/change-cell-renderers/) to both bring the users attention to a data change and also show or compare against the previous value.
