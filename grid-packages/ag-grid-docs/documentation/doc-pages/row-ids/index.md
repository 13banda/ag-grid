title: "Row IDs"
---


Each Row in the grid has a unique Row ID. These ID's are used by the grid to identify Rows, e.g. for identifying what Rows are selected.

The application can assign Row IDs using `getRowId()`, or you can have Grid Assigned Row IDs.

## Application Assigned IDs

Setting Row IDs is done using the `getRowId()` grid callback.

<snippet>
const gridOptions = {
    // assumes each data item provided by the application has the ID stored in an attribute called id
    getRowId: params => params.data.id
}
</snippet>

The example below has `getRowId()` implemented to return `params.data.id`. The Row ID is displayed inside the first Column.

## Grid Assigned IDs

If `getRowId()` is not provided, Row IDs are generated by the grid when data is set into the grid. The grid uses a sequence starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 to assign row IDs, so if for example there are three rows they will have IDs of `0`, `1` and `2`. The Row ID does not change for a Row once it is set.

If the Row Data is updated to a new set, the grid will continue with it's sequence. For example if 10 rows are initially set, IDs [0..9] are used. Then if the data is set again for another 10 rows, IDs [10..19] are used. This is true even if the second set of rows are logically identical to the first set of rows (i.e. it's a refresh operation).

When [Row Grouping](/grouping/) another zero based sequence is used and prefixed with `row-group-`. For example Row Groups will have IDs `row-group-0`, `row-group-1` and `row-group-2`.
