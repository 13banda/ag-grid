title: "Sass styling API"
---

The Sass styling API is a lightweight wrapper around [Design Customisations](/customising-design) and [Themes](/themes) that provides additional features and validation.

TODO:

Setting variables
 - Every [design customisation variable](/customising-design) variable is supported, but you do not need the `--ag-` prefix, so instead of setting `--ag-foreground-color: red` you set `foreground-color: red`.
 - TODO borders, borders-critical accept booleans. (note: must implement this!)
 - header-column-resize-handle (and the other one) work with booleans (note: implement this!)
 - 
Basic example

Color blending

Multiple themes

Suppressing native widget styles
