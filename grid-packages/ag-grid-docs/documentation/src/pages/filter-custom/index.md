title: "Custom Filter"
---

There are several ways to refine the way your column filters look and feel in ag-grid. They all based around components, which mean you can use your preferred framework to:

1. Create your own [custom filter](../filter-component/)
1. Create your own [custom floating filter](../floating-filter-component/)
1. Create your own [custom date component](../date-component/) and customise your own date picker (applies to the provided date filter and the date floating filter).
