title: "ag-Grid Packages & Modules"
---

Version 22.0.0 changes the way ag-Grid is made available by providing functionality in modules, allowing you to pick and choose which features you require, resulting in a smaller application size overall.

## Introduction

There are two main ways to install ag-Grid - either by using `packages` , or by using `modules`. [packages](../grid-packages) are the easiest way to use ag-Grid, but by default include all code specific to each package, whereas [modules](../grid-modules) allow you to cherry pick what functionality you want, which will allow for a reduced overall bundle size.

If you're unsure whether to use `packages` or `modules` then we'd recommend starting with `packages` and migrate to `modules` if you wish to reduce overall bundle size.
