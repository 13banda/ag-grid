#### 18th Jul 2023 - Grid v30.0.5 (Charts v8.0.5)

#### Standalone Charts

##### Bugfixes

- `'bar'` and `'area'` series have been reworked to address bugs relating to merging of options and processing:
  - Each series options configuration is now isolated - options specified apply only to the series they are added.
  - Each `'bar'` and `'area'` series is now correctly assigned a unique `seriesId` value.
