    <h1>Client-side Data - Single Row / Cell Updates</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        You can target updates to a single row or cell. Updating a single row means asking the grid to replace
        the data item for on specific row. Updating a cell means keeping the data item but asking the grid to
        replace one attribute of that data item.
    </p>

    <p>
        Doing both single row and single cell updates is done by firstly getting a reference
        to the row's Row Node and then using the relevant Row Node API method. See
        <a href="../javascript-grid-accessing-data/">Accessing Data</a> on how to get access
        Row Nodes.
        Once you have access to the required Row Node, you update it's data with the following
        Row Node API methods:
    </p>

    <ul class="content">
        <li><code>rowNode.setData(data):</code> Replaces the data on the rowNode. When
            complete, the grid will refresh the the entire rendered row if it is showing.</li>
        <li><code>rowNode.setDataValue(colKey, value):</code> Replaces the data on the
            rowNode for the specified column. When complete, the grid will refresh
            the rendered cell on the required row only.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>View Refresh</h2>

    <p>
        After calling <code>rowNode.setData()</code> or <code>rowNode.setDataValue()</code>
        the grid's view will automatically refresh to reflect the change. There is no
        need to manually request a refresh.
    </p>

    <h2>Sort / Filter / Group Refresh</h2>

    <p>
        After calling <code>rowNode.setData()</code> or <code>rowNode.setDataValue()</code>
        the grid will not update to reflect a change in sorting, filtering or grouping.
    </p>
    <p>
        To have the grid to update it's sort, filter or groping call the Grid API
        <code>refreshClientSideRowModel()</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want the grid to automatically update sorting, filter or grouping then you
        should consider using
        <a href="../javascript-grid-data-update-transactions/">Transaction Updates</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Updating Rows / Cells Example</h2>

    <p>
        The example below demonstrates the following:
    </p>

    <ul class="content">
        <li><b>Set Price on Toyota:</b> The price value is updated on the Toyota row and the grid refreshes the cell.</li>
        <li><b>Set Data on Ford:</b> The entire data is set on the Ford row and the grid refreshes the entire row.</li>
        <li><b>Sort:</b> Re-runs the sort in the Client-side Row Model - to see this in action, sort the data first, then
            edit the data so the sort is broken, then hit this button to fix the sort.</li>
        <li><b>Filter:</b> Re-runs the filter in the Client-side Row Model - to see this in action, filter the data first, then
            edit the data so the filter is broken (ie a row is present that should not be present), then hit this button to fix the filter.</li>
    </ul>
